# Spotify-Downloader

- Downloads songs fromÂ YouTube in an MP3 format by using Spotify's HTTP link.

- Can also download a song by entering its artist and song name (in case if you don't have the Spotify's HTTP link for some song).

- Automatically fixes song's meta-tags which include:

  - Title
  - Artist
  - Album
  - Album art
  - Album artist
  - Genre
  - Track number
  - Disc number
  - Release date

- Works straight out of the box and does not require to generate or mess with your API keys.

That's how your Music library will look like!

## Reporting Issues

- **Spotify made it mandatory to use a token to fetch track information. So, if you get rate limited or face any token problems, please let me know in [#58](https://github.com/Ritiek/Spotify-Downloader/issues/58).**

- Search for your problem in the [issues section](https://github.com/Ritiek/Spotify-Downloader/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=) before opening a new ticket. It might be already answered and save you and me some time :D.

- Provide as much information possible when opening your ticket.

## Installation & Usage

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Dg8p9up.png" width="600">

- This version supports both Python2 and Python3.

- Note: `play` and `lyrics` commands have been deprecated in the current brach since they were not of much use and created unnecessary clutter. You can still get them back by using `old` branch though.

### Debian, Ubuntu, Linux & Mac

```
cd
git clone https://github.com/Ritiek/Spotify-Downloader
cd Spotify-Downloader
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```
You'll also need to install avconv (use `--ffmpeg` option when using the script if you want `ffmpeg`):

`sudo apt-get install libav-tools` (`brew install libav` for Mac)

### Windows

Assuming you have Python already installed..

- Download Libav-Tools for windows: https://builds.libav.org/windows/release-gpl/libav-x86_64-w64-mingw32-11.7.7z. Copy all the contents of bin folder (of libav) to Scripts folder (in your python's installation directory).

- Download the zip file of this repository and extract its contents in your python's installation folder as well.

Shift+right-click on empty area and open cmd and type:

`"Scripts/pip.exe" install -U -r requirements.txt`

## Instructions for Downloading Songs

- For all available options, run `sudo python spotdl.py --help` (or for windows run `python.exe spotdl.py --help`).

#### Downloading by Name

For example

- We want to download Hello by Adele, simply run `python spotdl.py --song "adele hello"`.

- The script will automatically look for the best matching song and download it in the folder `Music/` placed in your current directory.

- It will now convert the song to an mp3 and try to fix meta-tags and album-art by looking up on Spotify.

#### Downloading by Spotify Link (Recommended)

For example

- We want to download the same song (i.e: Hello by Adele) but using Spotify Link this time that looks like  `http://open.spotify.com/track/1MDoll6jK4rrk2BcFRP5i7`, you can copy it from your Spotify desktop or mobile app by right clicking or long tap on the song and copy HTTP link.

- Run `python spotdl.py --song http://open.spotify.com/track/1MDoll6jK4rrk2BcFRP5i7`, it should download Hello by Adele.

- Just like before, it will again convert the song to an mp3 but since we used a Spotify HTTP link, the script is guaranteed to fetch the correct meta-tags and album-art.

#### Download multiple songs at once

For example

- We want to download `Hello by Adele`, `The Nights by Avicci` and `21 Guns by Green Day` just using a single command.

Let's suppose, we have the Spotify link for only `Hello by Adele` and `21 Guns by Green Day`.

No problem!

- Just make a `list.txt` in the same folder as the script and add all the songs you want to download, in our case it is

(if you are on windows, just edit `list.txt` - i.e `C:\Python27\list.txt`)

```
https://open.spotify.com/track/1MDoll6jK4rrk2BcFRP5i7
the nights avicci
http://open.spotify.com/track/64yrDBpcdwEdNY9loyEGbX
```

- Now pass `--list=list.txt` to the script, i.e `python spotdl.py --list=list.txt` and it will start downloading songs mentioned in `list.txt`.

- You can stop downloading songs by hitting `ctrl+c`, the script will automatically resume from the song where you stopped it the next time you want to download the songs present in `list.txt`.

- Songs that are already downloaded will be skipped and not be downloaded again.

#### Downloading playlists

- You can also load songs from any playlist provided you have spotify username of that user.

- Try running `python spotdl.py -u <your_username>`, it will show all your public playlists.

- Once you select the one you want to download, the script will load all the tracks from the playlist into `<playlist_name>.txt`

- Then you can simply run `python spotdl.py --list=<playlist_name>.txt` to download them all!

## FAQ

#### I get system cannot find the specified file when downloading?

Check out these issues [#22](https://github.com/Ritiek/Spotify-Downloader/issues/22), [#35](https://github.com/Ritiek/Spotify-Downloader/issues/35), [#36](https://github.com/Ritiek/Spotify-Downloader/issues/36).

#### How can I download whole playlist with its URI?

~~Currently this is not possible without generating unique tokens from Spotify but you can copy all the songs from a playlist and paste them in `list.txt`. I am avoiding tokens as much possible to retain the portability of this tool but if you would like to add it as an optional feature to this tool, PR's welcome!~~
This feautre has been added!

#### You write horrible code. What's wrong with you?
